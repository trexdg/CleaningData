# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Description

### Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in

### features.txt
### activity_labels.txt
### subject_train.txt
### x_train.txt
### y_train.txt
### subject_test.txt
### x_test.txt
### y_test.txt
### Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

## Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

### Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others. Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

## Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

### Merge data subset with the activityType table to include the descriptive activity names

## Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.

### Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject
